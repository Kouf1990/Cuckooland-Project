- `xxx-version.json` are `json` files containing all texts of `The RTM for the kids` for different languages (each file is a series of associations `"a-key-word": "a-text"`);
- `yyy-template.zzz` are `Sozi` and `Scribus` sources files where all text parts are replaced by keywords (enclosed in double curly brackets `{{a-key-word}}`);
- [main.js](main.js) is a `node.js` script which replaces all `{{-key-word}}` found in template files by the associated text found in `xxx-version.json` files.

The files generated by [main.js](main.js) are not directly usable, some processing are still needed (for `Sozi` files, see dedicated [Read Me](../SoziVersion/ReadMe.md) file).

Reminder to use the program [main.js](main.js): 
- `node.js` version to use is 10;
- command `npm install` can be used to install `nunjuks`, a library used by the program;
- command `node main.js` can be used to run the program.
